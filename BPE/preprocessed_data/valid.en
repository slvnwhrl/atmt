the baby did nothing but cry all last night .
I saw that one coming .

do you like Italian music ?
M@@ ar@@ k@@ k@@ u made eyes at Liisa .
half the har@@ m that is done in this world is due to people who want to feel important .

the fo@@ g was th@@ i@@ ck@@ en@@ ing quickly .
she explained a joke .
Tom bought a mi@@ c@@ r@@ os@@ cop@@ e for Mary .
I think Tom and Mary should tell John that they can &apos;t really speak French .
I made Tom go home .
the teacher em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ zed the im@@ por@@ t@@ ance of education .
it &apos;s hi@@ gh@@ ly un@@ likely that Tom will drink any beer .

Mary is older than her husband .
he died a few days later .
I speak French and English .
Tom is still unemployed .
people are more e@@ du@@ cated now than they used to be .
if you aren &apos;t there by 10 : 0@@ 0 , we &apos;ll leave without you .

Unfortunately , it would be too difficult to find support for this .
di@@ vi@@ de it among the three .
the pro@@ f@@ its were very high .

have you spoken to your parents about this ?
we &apos;ll meet again .
Tom went shopping with his family .
watch out for the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans .
but J@@ es@@ us on his part did not en@@ trust himself to them , because he knew all people and needed no one to bear wi@@ t@@ ness about man , for he himself knew what was in man .
a man suddenly appeared in the do@@ or@@ way .
I &apos;m sorry if this comes as a sho@@ ck , but I don &apos;t care what you think .
Tom didn &apos;t know what to do .
Tom and I were up all night talking .
great men are not always wise .
keep your voice down .

I don &apos;t wear glasses anymore .
